## Eat Fish Game
This is a game developed by Ziyi Li.

## How to play:
In this game, you will play a role as a cat, and you need to eat fish on screen.  
Everytime when you eat a fish, you will get 1 point.  
You canâ€™t touch the edge or the road you have walked.  
If you hit that, the game is over.  
To simplify, you will lose only when the center of cat hit the trajectory, but you don't need to "eat" by the center of cat.  

## Customise
By default, the keys are WASD, and the boss key is X.  
The configuration file "config.json", provides the settings for the following options
* Direction key
* Boss key
* Background color
* Move speed (not suggest to change)

## Leaderboard
You can see the leaderboard of the game by clicking "leaderboard" bottom.  
The data is saved in "leaderboard.txt".  
If user leave the name blank and starts the game, the default name will be "anonymous".

## Cheating:
use "+" and "-" can directly change the points
