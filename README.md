## Eat Fish Game
This is a game developed by Ziyi Li.

## How to play:
In this game, you will play a role as a cat, and you need to eat fish on screen.
Everytime when you eat a fish, you will get 1 point.
You canâ€™t touch the edge or the road you have walked.
If you hit that, the game is over.
To simplify, you will lose only when the center of cat hit the trajectory, but you don't need to "eat" by the center of cat.

By default, the keys are WASD, and the boss key is X. You can change setting in "config.json"
